# Backstage Documentation Standards

This document outlines the documentation standards for the Backstage Flutter package to ensure production-worthy, clear, and comprehensive documentation throughout the codebase.

## Documentation Principles

### 1. Comprehensive Coverage
- **Every public class, method, and property** must have dartdoc documentation
- **Complex private methods** should also be documented
- **Architecture and design decisions** must be explained

### 2. Clear and Concise Language
- Use **active voice** and **present tense**
- Write for developers who may be unfamiliar with the codebase
- Avoid ambiguous terms like "handles," "manages," or "processes"

### 3. Practical Examples
- Include **code examples** for complex APIs
- Show **real-world usage scenarios**
- Demonstrate **common patterns** and **best practices**

## Dartdoc Comment Standards

### Class Documentation
```dart
/// A comprehensive logging system that captures application events and errors
/// for debugging purposes in production environments.
///
/// The [BackstageLogger] provides structured logging capabilities with support
/// for multiple log levels, custom tags, and stack trace capture. It uses a
/// broadcast stream to allow multiple listeners to consume log events.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// final logger = BackstageLogger();
/// logger.i('User logged in successfully', tag: 'auth');
/// logger.e('Database connection failed', tag: 'db', st: stackTrace);
/// ```
///
/// See also:
/// * [BackstageLog] for the log entry data structure
/// * [BackstageLevel] for available log levels
class BackstageLogger {
  // implementation
}
```

### Method Documentation
```dart
/// Adds a new log entry to the stream and notifies all listeners.
///
/// The [log] parameter contains the complete log information including
/// timestamp, message, level, and optional stack trace. The log is
/// immediately broadcast to all active stream subscribers.
///
/// This method is thread-safe and can be called from any isolate.
///
/// Example:
/// ```dart
/// logger.add(BackstageLog(
///   message: 'Operation completed',
///   level: BackstageLevel.info,
///   tag: 'operation',
/// ));
/// ```
void add(BackstageLog log) => _controller.add(log);
```

### Property Documentation
```dart
/// A broadcast stream that emits all log entries added to this logger.
///
/// Multiple listeners can subscribe to this stream simultaneously. Each
/// listener receives all log entries from the time they subscribe. The
/// stream never closes unless the logger is explicitly disposed.
///
/// Use this stream to build custom log viewers, filters, or persistence
/// layers on top of the core logging functionality.
Stream<BackstageLog> get stream => _controller.stream;
```

## Code Organization Standards

### File Headers
Each source file should begin with:
```dart
/// Core logging functionality for the Backstage debugging console.
///
/// This file contains the primary logging classes and utilities used
/// throughout the Backstage package for capturing and managing log
/// entries in production Flutter applications.
///
/// The main components are:
/// * [BackstageLogger] - The primary logging interface
/// * [BackstageLog] - Individual log entry data structure  
/// * [BackstageLevel] - Log severity levels
/// * [BackstageTag] - Type alias for log categorization
```

### Import Organization
```dart
// Standard library imports
import 'dart:async';
import 'dart:io';

// Flutter framework imports
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';

// Third-party package imports
import 'package:shared_preferences/shared_preferences.dart';

// Local package imports
import 'capture.dart';
import 'logger.dart';
import 'storage.dart';
```

## Architecture Documentation Requirements

### High-Level Design
- Document the overall architecture and component relationships
- Explain design patterns and architectural decisions
- Describe data flow and lifecycle management

### API Design
- Document public APIs with usage examples
- Explain configuration options and their implications
- Provide migration guides for breaking changes

### Performance Considerations
- Document memory usage patterns
- Explain threading model and concurrency safety
- Describe resource cleanup requirements

## Documentation Review Checklist

Before considering documentation complete, verify:

- [ ] All public APIs have comprehensive dartdoc comments
- [ ] Examples are provided for complex functionality
- [ ] Architecture decisions are documented
- [ ] Performance implications are noted
- [ ] Thread safety is documented where relevant
- [ ] Error conditions and handling are explained
- [ ] Dependencies and relationships are clear
- [ ] Migration paths are provided for breaking changes

## Tools and Automation

### Documentation Generation
- Use `dart doc` to generate HTML documentation
- Ensure all documentation builds without warnings
- Include generated docs in CI/CD pipeline

### Linting
- Enable dartdoc linting rules in `analysis_options.yaml`
- Require documentation for all public APIs
- Enforce consistent documentation formatting
